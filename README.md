This project is an e-commerce web implementation using a suite of modern technologies, including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TRPC, Prisma, and NextAuth.

## Key Technologies

### Next.js

[Next.js (https://nextjs.org/) is a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. We chose Next.js for its ease of use and full support for server-side and static rendering.

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for design and styling. Tailwind's utility-first approach allows us to easily create responsive and attractive interfaces.

### TRPC

[TRPC](https://trpc.io/) (pronounced 'trips') is a TypeScript library that allows us to define API endpoints with static types, providing the benefits of autocompletion and static analysis.

### Prisma

[Prisma (https://www.prisma.io/) is used as an ORM for managing and interacting with databases. It provides an easy-to-use abstraction for accessing and transforming data.

### NextAuth

[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) is a library for authentication and authorization in Next.js. We use it to provide a secure and convenient login experience.
